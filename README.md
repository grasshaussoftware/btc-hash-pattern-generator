# Bitcoin Hash Pattern Generator

## Introduction
Bitcoin Hash Pattern Generator is a React-based web application that allows users to visualize Bitcoin public key addresses in a unique and artistic way. By inputting a Bitcoin public key address, the application generates a distinct pattern of black and white blocks, representing the unique hash of the wallet. This tool serves not only as a means of artistic expression but also aids in the visual identification of Bitcoin addresses. The application is accessible at [pixelmaker.xyz](https://pixelmaker.xyz).
